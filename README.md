# tf.keras-fcn8s

Tensorflow implementation of Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation (FCNs).

The implementation is largely based on the reference code provided by the authors of the paper link. The model was applied on the Scene Parsing Challenge dataset provided by MIT http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/.

1、tf.keras.layers build model

2、reference: Thanks to shekkizh's and 4 wucng's open source code

1)shekkizh: git clone https://github.com/shekkizh/FCN.tensorflow.git

2)wucng： git clone https://github.com/fengzhongyouxia/TensorExpand.git
